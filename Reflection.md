Project Reflection:

The steps you took to create and manage branches:
-- Used git checkout -b feature/header to create a feature/header branch from main branch
-- Added features in the feature/header branch.
-- Staged it using git add filename
-- Committed using git commit -m "Message"

How you handled the merge conflict.
-- Merge the feature/header branch with the main branch
-- Once conflict occurs, compare the current branch with the incoming branch codes and decide which code we need for that scenerio.
-- Remove unwanted codes and conflict symbols.
-- Stage and commit using git add filename, git commit -m "Message".
-- push it to remote if needed

How the pull request process helped you ensure code quality and collaboration.
--Once the pull Request is made, the reviewers will review the code and check for any errors, logical mistakes or any other correction and make comment on that corrections.
--we can correct our mistakes and create a quality code by collabrating with peers.
--In that way, the improper code will not be merged with the main code.
--Implementing Github Actions to automate workflows for code reviews.
